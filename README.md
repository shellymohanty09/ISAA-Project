# ISAA-Project
TRAINING THE PROPOSED MODEL :
1. Download the dataset from the provided link and divide into training and test datasets.
2. Open the codes from the zip file in kaggle platform.
3. Run the codes one by one to train the model with the training dataset.
4. Run tests using the test dataset and the analysis report would be shown.
5. That will give the accuracy of the proposed model and the training would be done
completely and now it is ready to be used in the web application.


WEB APPLICATION :
1. We fetch the codes from the zip file and open it using vs code.
2. Run the code and the web page for malware classification opens.
3. Upload the desired malware image in the specified place.
4. The website makes use of the proposed detection model and displays the class of
malware that the uploaded image belongs to.


PYTHON :
1. Open the terminal to run python files which will testify that the proposed model is
blocking malware files from reaching the target.
2. Run receiver.py in the terminal.
3. A link is formed and the malware is ready to be sent to the target.
4. Run sender.py in the terminal.
5. The file containing the malware is blocked from reaching its destination
